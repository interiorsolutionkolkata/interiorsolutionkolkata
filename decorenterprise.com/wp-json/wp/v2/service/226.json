Aimed at providing a neat and finished look, cornice designs have become a significant part of contemporary architecture. Derived from the French and Italian architectural designs, these beautiful structures endow a perfect image to the Indian interior spaces.<\/p>\n<p>It is true that even the minutest details can make a huge difference to the aesthetic beauty and euphony of a place. Thus, cornice designs render the much needed style and perfect finishing to your ceilings that help in striking a great balance with all other beautiful interior design features.<\/p>\n<h4>TYPES OF CORNICE DESIGNS<\/h4>\n<p>Cornice designs come in two types of material choices- Gypsum and Plaster of Paris. Even though both the materials contain calcium sulphite, in gypsum these cornices are reinforced with polyurethane. This is what gives gypsum cornices an edge over Plaster of Paris, making them stronger and much easier to drill through. Also, gypsum cornice designs are moisture resistant which prevents the absorption of moisture from the roof.<\/p>\n<h4>ABOUT GYPSUM CORNICE DESIGNS<\/h4>\n<p>Gypsum cornice designs come in a variety of patterns such as plain, carved, geometric and floral. You can choose the design that effectively matches with your overall theme of the room. If your theme and style calls for something simple and streamlined, you can opt for a plain gypsum cornice. For giving a traditional look to your false ceiling, you can install a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/decorenterprise.com\/contact-us\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">carved cornice design<\/a>, thus adding a new dimension of detail. You can also go in for an eccentric geometric gypsum cornice for places such as offices, restaurants, and hotel lobbies etc. Each pattern comes with a distinctive look adding the required value to your interior spaces.<\/p>\n<h4>INSTALLING A GYPSUM CORNICE DESIGN<\/h4>\n<p>These cornices are easy to install and should be planned after the false ceiling structure is ready. You can either adorn the fan or the light points with these. Prefer not to do both. Select plain cornices for the rooms that feature heavy furnishing styles to create a harmony. Also, try to maintain continuity from one room to another.<\/p>\n<h4>CHOOSE US<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/decorenterprise.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">D\u00e9cor Enterprise<\/a>&nbsp;presents a collection of readymade gypsum cornice designs that can be effectively used to adorn your home ceilings.
